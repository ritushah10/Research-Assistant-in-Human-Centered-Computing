A bit of time ago the Surgeon General of the United States issued a loneliness epidemic, cautioning on the negative effects of loneliness on the mental and physical body. This project is a further investigation of feelings of loneliness and feelings of belonging specifically on the Northeastern campus. This issue is unique to Northeastern because of the campus culture transition periods, namely co-op, and the university's encouragement to move around. 

To understand the root causes of widespread loneliness, we began by exploring the current meaning of community and how technology has transformed it. We delved into expert analyses on how social media has reshaped intimacy, and how online communities now rival in-person ones. We also examined the impact of surveillance capitalism and the attention economy, where the power of connection is exploited for profit, prioritizing engagement over genuine communication. Our research focused on how these changes affect people's ability to build community and alter perceptions of intimacy, as well as the deeper implications of loneliness on mental and physical health.
